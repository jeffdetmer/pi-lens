# Store freshness model

A TLA+ model of one cached result about one input file X, and the gate that
later decides whether to serve it. It covers the stores that use the
freshness kernel (`clients/freshness.ts`, #1739). X is the file whose bytes
the result was computed from: the diagnosed file (own axis) or a file it
imports (dependency axis). The `TLA+ models` CI job
(`node scripts/check-tla-models.mjs`) checks every config here against its
`\* expect:` line.

Issues: #3503, #3504, #3505.

## What the model covers

- **The writer.** External or concurrent writes of X. Each write sets
  `mtime = trunc_Gran(clock + lead)`, where the lead is `0..Skew`. The lead
  is the #1710 Windows skew: an mtime can lead `Date.now()`.
- **The computation.** `Start`, then `Read` (the bytes the result is
  computed from), then `Record` (the store write). Time can pass between
  steps. `ServerLag` lets the read come before `Start`, like a pull server
  answering from a model it loaded earlier.
- **The store.** The reference timestamp: `Stamp = "start"` (before the
  read) or `"end"` (at record). For `eq`, it also keeps the recorded stat
  (`StatAt` before or after the read) and a content hash (`BindingAt`: the
  bytes read, or the disk at record).
- **The gate:**
  - `mtime`: `freshnessFromMtime`;
  - `content`: size, then sha256 of the bytes read;
  - `sizeMtime`: `detectSelfDrift`; `ForceHash` models it without its old
    mtime fast path;
  - `eq`: `isEntryFresh` own-file equality, plus the #1095 binding;
  - `none`: a mutant with no gate.

  The gate can run several times. `Latch` makes a demotion permanent.

The clock is explicit, one tick is about 25 ms, and events can share a tick.
`mtimeId` makes two writes compare unequal on a fine filesystem
(`Gran = 1`), where `mtimeMs` has sub-ms digits.

## Invariants

- `NoStaleServe`: a served result was computed on the bytes on disk when
  the gate ran.
- `NoStaleServeBeyondTol`: the same, except for the admitted window. A stale
  serve is excused only when the first write after the read landed at or
  after the reference instant, and within `Tol + Gran` of it.
- `NoSpuriousDemotion`: if nothing was written since the reference instant,
  the result is not demoted. This is the reason the tolerance exists
  (`FixReadStampNoTol`). It cannot see a stamp taken too early: see Scope and
  limits.
- `NoRepromotion`: a demoted result is not served again unless the bytes
  match.

## Store map

| Store | Reference | Taken relative to the read | Gate | Config |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| widget-state own file, per entry (`reconcileStaleWidgetFiles`) | `observedAt` = the pipeline's `analysisReadAtMs`, passed to `recordDiagnostics` (#3503); `lsp_diagnostics`' fresh row: its `scannedAt` (#3505) | before | mtime | `WidgetOwnLateStamp`: pass. Mutant `MutWidgetOwnLateStamp` (record-time stamp): violated |
| widget-state dependency axis (`reconcileStaleWidgetDependencyBlockers`, and the turn-end sweep's widget rows via `getWidgetBlockingFilesForSweep`) | same `observedAt` | before | mtime | same shape as `BlockerDepLateStamp` |
| inline blocker, import axis (`detectDrift`) | `recordedAtMs` = the pipeline's `analysisReadAtMs`, threaded through `recordInlineBlockers` (#3503) | before | mtime, latched | `BlockerDepLateStamp`: pass. Mutant `MutBlockerDepLateStamp`: violated |
| inline blocker, own file, all-LSP | size+sha256 of the bytes the pipeline analysed | at the read | content | `BlockerLspOwn`: pass, mtime regress included |
| inline blocker, own file, non-LSP | size+sha256, with no mtime fast path (#3504) | at the read | content | `BlockerNonLspOwnFastPath`: pass. Mutant `MutBlockerNonLspOwnFastPath` (late stamp + fast path): violated; `FixBlockerReadStampStrict` (read stamp, fast path kept): violated |
| workspace-diagnostics cache, own file, per-file sweep | stat mtime+size, taken before the pre-open read or `processFile`'s own read (#3505) | before | eq | `WorkspaceOwnStatAfterRead`: pass. Mutant `MutWorkspaceOwnStatAfterRead`: violated |
| workspace-diagnostics cache, own file, pull | stat after the answer, and a disk hash taken after the answer | after the server answered | eq | `WorkspaceOwnPullPostHocHash`: **violated** (#3505 part b, not fixed here; `FixWorkspacePullBinding` is the checked fix) |
| workspace-diagnostics cache, own file, `lsp_diagnostics` | stat before its read | before | eq | the shape `WorkspaceOwnStatAfterRead` now models |
| workspace-diagnostics cache, own file, coarse mtime | (mtime, size) inside one coarse granule | | eq | `WorkspaceOwnCoarseSameSize`: violated, admitted (#2300) |
| workspace-diagnostics cache, dependency axis | per-file `scannedAt`, taken before the file's read (a pull: before its request; `lsp_diagnostics`: before its stat) (#3505) | before | mtime | the same unlatched mtime gate as the widget row: `WidgetOwnLateStamp` / `MutWidgetOwnLateStamp` |
| project-diagnostics snapshot | size+sha256 per file; `scannedAt` after the loop only for rows without a fingerprint | at the read | content | not committed (see below) |
| advisory-provenance (gitleaks/trivy/opengrep/govulncheck `scannedAt`) | `new Date()` at `runScan` entry | before the spawn | mtime | not committed (see below) |
| late-aux drain | `markedAtMs` | see `formal/late-aux-drain` | | |
| freshness-cadence | a TTL, not a reference stamp | | | not modelled |

The investigation behind these issues also checked the stores this change
does not touch: the project-diagnostics snapshot (`ProjectDiagContent` pass,
957k states; its pre-#2154 mtime-only and size-only mutants violated), the
advisory stamp (`AdvisoryStartStamp` pass), the coarse-mtime and mtime-regress
assumptions, and the #1095 and #2300 workspace bindings. Those configs are not
committed: the `TLA+ models` job already takes 352 s of its 10 minute cap on
master (run 36249982514), and they would add about two minutes for stores
with no change here. The configs below are the ones these fixes flip, their
mutants, and the non-vacuity and tolerance checks the flips rest on.
## Code map

The fixed code each passing config models, and the replay that pins it
(`tests/clients/store-freshness-formal.test.ts`,
`tests/clients/lsp/workspace-diagnostics-store-freshness.test.ts`,
`tests/tools/lsp-diagnostics-cache.test.ts`).

- `Stamp = "start"` for the pipeline stores: `clients/pipeline.ts`
  `analysisReadAtMs`, taken before the first read, re-taken before the
  post-format read (`runFormatPhase`'s `fileReadAtMs`) and the post-autofix
  re-read, so pi-lens' own writes land before it. It is passed to
  `recordDiagnostics` and returned as `PipelineResult.analysisReadAtMs`, which
  `clients/runtime-tool-result.ts` threads into `recordInlineBlockers`.
- `ForceHash = TRUE`: `clients/blocker-freshness.ts` `detectSelfDrift` has no
  mtime tier; a matching size goes straight to the hash budget and the hash.
- `StatAt = "before"` and `Stamp = "start"` for the sweep:
  `clients/lsp/index.ts` `noteScanStat`, called before the pre-open read and
  before `processFile`'s own read; a pull stamps `pullStartedAt` before its
  request. `record()` takes the stamp as its `scannedAt`
  (`clients/lsp/workspace-diagnostics-cache.ts`). `tools/lsp-diagnostics.ts`
  stamps before its stat and passes the same stamp as its fresh widget
  row's `observedAt` (review round 1); its single-file mode stamps the row
  before its touch (review round 2).

## Results

TLC 1.7.4, `-workers auto`, 4 cores. The state count is distinct states. For
a violated config, the count is where the first counterexample was found, and
it varies with worker scheduling.

| `WidgetOwnLateStamp` | pass | 36,071 | 2.3 |
| `BlockerDepLateStamp` | pass | 36,071 | 4.6 |

| `MutWidgetOwnLateStamp` (record-time stamp) | violated NoStaleServeBeyondTol | 1,901 | 2.0 |
| `MutBlockerDepLateStamp` (record-time stamp) | violated NoStaleServeBeyondTol | 2,128 | 2.2 |

| `MutBlockerNonLspOwnFastPath` (late stamp + fast path) | violated NoStaleServeBeyondTol | 1,067 | 2.0 |
| `FixBlockerReadStampStrict` (read stamp, fast path kept) | violated NoStaleServe | 695 | 2.0 |
| `WorkspaceOwnStatAfterRead` | pass | 156,415 | 4.0 |
| `MutWorkspaceOwnStatAfterRead` (stat after the read) | violated NoStaleServe | 1,583 | 1.8 |
| `WorkspaceOwnPullPostHocHash` (pull path, #3505 part b open) | violated NoStaleServe | 1,587 | 1.8 |
| `FixWorkspacePullBinding` (the checked part b fix) | pass | 206,290 | 4.7 |

| `WorkspaceOwnCoarseSameSize` | violated NoStaleServe (admitted, #2300) | 688 | 1.6 |

Times are from a shared 4-core host at load average 11 (review round 1).

## Traces

**Late record stamp** (`MutWidgetOwnLateStamp`, `MutBlockerDepLateStamp`;
`MutBlockerNonLspOwnFastPath` has the same trace with an equal-size write):

1. Start.
2. Read v1 at t=0.
3. A write lands at t=0 with mtime 0.
4. Tick.
5. Record at t=1 stamps `ref = 1`.
6. The gate computes `0 > 1 + Tol` = false and serves v1 while disk holds v2.

The offending write is before the reference, so the tolerance does not
excuse it.

**Stat after read** (`MutWorkspaceOwnStatAfterRead`):

1. Read v1.
2. A write lands v2.
3. Record stats v2's mtime and size.
4. The gate finds the stat equal to disk and serves v1.

## Scope and limits

- One input file per config. A result with many dependencies is the union
  of per-dependency configs, because the gates check each file
  independently.
- For the dependency axis, `Read` means "the analysis consumed the
  dependency's bytes". For an LSP verdict that point is not observable. A
  server answering from an older in-memory view of the dependency reads
  before any stamp pi-lens can take, which is `ServerLag`. The read-stamp fix
  closes the pi-lens-side window, not server lag.
- The model cannot catch a stamp taken too early. `NoSpuriousDemotion`
  only says a result is not demoted when nothing was written after its
  reference; a reference pinned far in the past satisfies it whenever any
  write happened. A scratch mutant with `ref' = 0` in `Start` passes
  `BlockerDepLateStamp`, `WidgetOwnLateStamp` and `FixReadStampWide`. The
  too-early direction (a verdict demoted by pi-lens' own format or autofix
  write, or by a write before the read) is pinned by the vitest cases
  instead: `FixReadStamp no-drop (#3503)` and `FixReadStamp control (#3503)`
  in `tests/clients/store-freshness-formal.test.ts` (mutations M3, M4, M5),
  the `FixReadStamp no-drop (#3505)` cases for the sweep (W3, W5, W7), and
  the `lsp_diagnostics` widget-row cases in
  `tests/tools/lsp-diagnostics-cache.test.ts` (R1b, R2b).
  Modelling the read instant separately from the stamp would close this.
- A runner that reads the file from disk itself during the dispatch reads
  after the stamp. That is the safe direction: a write between the stamp and
  that runner's read can demote a result computed on the new bytes, but can
  never leave a stale one served.
- There is no ABA (content returning to earlier bytes), no `touch` (mtime
  moving without content), and no deletion. Every write changes the bytes.
- Ordering between two computations of the same file is not modelled
  (`formal/dispatch-pipeline` covers the inline record's write order).
- The tick scale is coarse: `Tol = 2` is 50 ms with one tick at 25 ms.
- Assumptions, not bugs: an mtime restored to an older value by `cp -p`, tar
  or `rsync -t`, and an mtime granularity coarser than 50 ms
  (`WorkspaceOwnCoarseSameSize`, #2300).
- `BlockerLspOwn` runs with two writes in six ticks (three in eight in the
  investigation, 957k states) to fit the CI budget.
