/**
 * #3530: properties of the per-path notify queue (`enqueueDocumentNotify`)
 * over the interleavings fast-check's scheduler picks, instead of one
 * hand-written replay per interleaving.
 *
 * Recurrence this file prevents: three regressions of this one queue in one
 * day, each caught only by a replay of the interleaving it was written for —
 * #3481 (an older read sent after a newer one), #3477 (a touch queued before
 * rename's close re-opened the path after didClose) and the #3491 verify-round
 * close-stamp drop (a close inherited a stale touch's read stamp and was
 * dropped with it, so no didClose went out). The property reds on each of
 * them re-applied as a mutation of the built client; the #3530 PR body quotes
 * the shrunk counterexamples.
 *
 * Production chain: the REAL `handleNotifyOpen` / `handleNotifyChange` /
 * `closeDocument` over `createMockState`. Two awaits are handed to the
 * scheduler: the JSON-RPC `sendNotification` (the process boundary) and the
 * `access` existence probe (the file system; `closedAndGone` and the
 * first-open watcher notify). Both answer from the test's model at call time
 * and resolve when the scheduler releases them, so the scheduler, not I/O
 * timing, decides every interleaving and a seed replays exactly.
 *
 * The oracle is the test's own: which touch holds the newest read, what the
 * server holds, and when a close settled come from the command log and the
 * recorded wire, never from the queue's state.
 *
 * How to write one of these: `tests/support/scheduler-properties.md`.
